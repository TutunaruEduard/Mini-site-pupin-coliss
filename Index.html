        also known as Michael I. Pupin, was a Serbian American physicist and physical chemist. </h2>
    <h3>Pupin is best known for his numerous patents, including a means of greatly extending the range of long-distance
        telephone communication by placing loading coils (of wire) at predetermined intervals along the transmitting
        wire (known as "pupinization"). </h3>
